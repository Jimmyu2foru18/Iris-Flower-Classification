# Iris Flower Classification Project Proposal

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three distinct species based on their sepal and petal measurements. The project will serve as a practical implementation of supervised learning techniques using R programming language.

## Objectives
1. Create a robust classification model for iris flower species identification
2. Demonstrate data visualization and analysis techniques
3. Implement and evaluate machine learning algorithms
4. Provide a reproducible R-based solution

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- Utilize the built-in iris dataset from R or scikit-learn
- Dataset contains 150 samples with 4 features:
  - Sepal length
  - Sepal width
  - Petal length
  - Petal width

### Data Analysis & Visualization
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - Statistical summaries
   - Feature distributions
   - Correlation analysis
2. Data Visualization
   - Box plots
   - Scatter plots
   - Pair plots

### Model Development
1. Data Preprocessing
   - Data splitting (training/testing sets)
   - Feature scaling if necessary
2. Model Selection
   - Primary: Decision Tree Classifier
   - Alternative models for comparison:
     - Random Forest
     - Support Vector Machine
3. Model Training and Validation
   - Cross-validation
   - Hyperparameter tuning

### Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy score
- Confusion matrix
- Classification report
- ROC curves

## Technical Stack
- R programming language
- Key libraries:
  - caret: for model training and evaluation
  - ggplot2: for data visualization
  - dplyr: for data manipulation
  - tidyr: for data cleaning

## Expected Outcomes
1. A well-documented R codebase
2. Trained classification model with accuracy metrics
3. Visual representations of data and results
4. Comprehensive analysis report
